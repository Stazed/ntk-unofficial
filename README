# What is NTK? #

NTK is a fork of FLTK 1.3.0 which adds graphics rendering via
Cairo, support for transparent/overlapping widgets, streamlining
of internals, and some new/improved widgets.

# LICENSING #

NTK has the same license as FLTK.

# Documentation #

Currently, there is none (beyond the FLTK 1.3 docs)

# Building #

# Dependencies #
    python=2.5-3.8  -  (for waf)
    cairo
    gcc-libs
    fontconfig
    glibc
    libfreetype.so=6-64
    libjpeg

NTK uses the 'waf' build system.
     
     Type:
         ./waf configure --help 
         
to see compilation options.

# Building and installing #

It is recommended that this unofficial version be installed to /usr/ rather than the default location of /usr/local/.
Doing so will replace any system installed version of NTK if it is packaged by your distribution. If you choose to install to /usr/local/, it may require setting some environment variables and has been found to cause runtime anomalies. Installing to /usr/local/ is not supported for this unofficial version.

To install to /usr/ use the following:

    ./waf configure --prefix=/usr/ --libdir=/usr/lib/
    ./waf
    sudo ./waf install

# Usage #

NTK uses pkg-config for publishing library information.
