# What is NTK? #

NTK is a fork of FLTK 1.3.0 which adds graphics rendering via
Cairo, support for transparent/overlapping widgets, streamlining
of internals, and some new/improved widgets.

# LICENSING #

NTK has the same license as FLTK.

# Documentation #

Currently, there is none (beyond the FLTK 1.3 docs)

# Building #

# Dependencies #
    python=2.5-3.8  -  (for waf)
    cairo
    gcc-libs
    fontconfig
    glibc
    libfreetype.so=6-64
    libjpeg
    libpng
    libx11
    libxft
    zlib

NTK uses the 'waf' build system.
     
     Type:
         ./waf configure --help 
         
to see compilation options.

Building and installing generally goes like:

     ./waf configure --libdir=/usr/local/lib/
     ./waf
     sudo ./waf install

# Usage #

NTK uses pkg-config for publishing library information.

If your pkg-config cannot find the library which is installed by default to: /usr/local/lib
and the *.pc files in folder /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig you may need to add to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH:

     export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH

If you have a runtime error indicating that the libntk*.so cannot be found then you may need to
add to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib

You can add the above export commands to your ~.bashrc file to make them permanent.
The installation locations can be changed with waf.
If you wish to install NTK to /usr/ instead of /usr/local/ it will not be necessary to set the export commands.

Use the following commands to install to /usr/:

    ./waf configure --prefix=/usr/ --libdir=/usr/lib/
    ./waf
    sudo ./waf install
